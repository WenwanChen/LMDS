# MDS and LMDS
A multidimensional scaling (MDS) and landmark multidimensional scaling (LMDS) implementation.

TL;DR: MDS can be used (among other things) to project data to lower dimensions but it needs a distance matrix of NxN, where N is the number of samples. LMDS can project using a matrix of LxN, where L is the number of landmark points and L<<N.
